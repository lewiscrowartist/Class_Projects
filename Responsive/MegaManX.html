<h2>How Mega Man X Connects to Mega Man Zero</h2>
    <p>The Mega Man Zero series takes place roughly 100 years after the events of the Mega Man X games, forming a direct continuation of the X timeline. The story bridges through the collapse and rebirth of society following centuries of conflict between humans and Reploids..</p>
    
    <h3>Mega Man X vs Mega Man Zero</h3>
    <p>The Mega Man X series focuses on fast, accessible action-platforming built around X’s mobility dashing, wall jumping, and long range charged shots. Combat emphasizes using boss weapons and exploring stages for armor upgrades, heart tanks, and secrets. Levels are traditional and self contained, designed to let players move quickly and stylishly while still feeling in control. Overall, X’s gameplay is smoother, more forgiving, and centered on steady power progression.

The Mega Man Zero series, set 100 years later, is much faster, harder, and more technical. Zero’s combat leans heavily on close-range melee attacks with the Z-Saber, supported by additional weapons that require skill and timing. Missions are short, intense, and tied to a ranking system that rewards precision and penalizes mistakes, making player skill more important than upgrades. Instead of armor pieces, Zero improves through weapon mastery, Cyber-Elf choices, and high rank EX skills, creating a tougher, more execution focused experience.</p>
