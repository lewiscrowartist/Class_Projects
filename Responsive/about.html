    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>Similar to the Mega Man X series, the Mega Man Zero series is a two-dimensional action platform game with run-and-gun elements that places a heavy emphasis on memorizing boss patterns and selecting the correct weapons to use against enemies.</p>
    <p>Unlike the previous series, the stages of Mega Man Zero are inside of areas that are part of a larger map, and the player can freely explore these areas once the respective mission(s) in each area is completed.</p>
    <h3>Plot</h3>
    <p>Centuries after disappearing at the end of the Mega Man X series, Zero is found and awakened by Ciel, a 12-year-old human scientist. Zero, unsure of who he is due to temporary memory loss, protects Ciel and her band of Reploids from a group sent out to destroy them. During the events of the game, as Zero fights off several attempts to destroy the remaining Reploids, it is unveiled what happened during his 100-year absence: After the Maverick War that took place during the Mega Man X series — where humans were being purged by malevolent Reploids, known as Mavericks — drew to a close with the Mavericks suffering total defeat, humans and Reploids were able to live in harmony in a utopian state known as Neo Arcadia. Unfortunately, this peace was short-lived due to the energy shortage crisis which led to the murdering of countless innocent Reploids to reduce energy consumption. Ciel thus banded with the Reploids and founded the Resistance. It is also revealed that a copy of X — Zero's former ally and best friend — is the leader of Neo Arcadia and the mastermind behind the Reploid genocide. After defeating the Four Guardians — Copy X's right-hand generals — Zero eventually confronts Copy X and defeats him in battle. While dying, Copy X self-destructs and Zero barely manages to escape. He then finds himself in an endless desert, surrounded by Neo Arcadian troops. Knowing that Neo Arcadia will focus their attention on him, Zero decides to stay in the desert and fight endlessly in hopes of giving Ciel and the resistance the time needed to escape.</p>
